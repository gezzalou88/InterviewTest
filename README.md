Website requirements

Needs the following four pages:

•	Home
•	About
•	Work
•	Contact

Header

The site-wide header will consist of two elements – the Company logo and the main navigation menu. 
The logo must sit on the left side of the header and act as a link to the home page. 
The navigation must sit on the right side of the header and will contain the 4 following links:
•	Home
•	About
•	Work
•	Contact

Footer
The site-wide footer should contain the following information:
•	Email address
•	Telephone number
•	Address
•	Facebook link
•	Twitter link
Alternatively, you could implement a twitter feed into the footer

Home Page
The home page must consist of 4 main sections. The first section is a banner. This will act as a link to portfolio pieces. For the purposes of this test, they need only link to the ‘Work’ page. 

The banner can simply be one of the provided portfolio images with some text overlaid.

Alternatively, the banner could be a carousel, with multiple slides for each portfolio piece. You are free to use whatever code to create such a carousel. You can build one yourself or use an open source solution. Details such as transitions (slides, fades, etc.) and carousel controls (if any) will be left up to you. 

The other three sections of the home page will be buttons for the three other pages (‘About’, ‘Work’ and ‘Contact’). We’d like these buttons to be aligned as three columns below the banner. 

About page

The about page should consists of two main areas. Firstly, it should have an area for the pages main content. This section should be roughly 2 thirds of the page width. 

The second section should be a sidebar to the right of the main area, roughly one third the width of the page. It should have a title that reads ‘Latest Work’, this will act as a list of portfolio links. Place the three portfolio piece logos here and have those all link to the ‘Work’ page. 

Work page

The Work page should contain a list of portfolio pieces. The list items should be display in a three column structure. 

For the purposes of this test, each list item can simply link back to the ‘Work’ page. 

Contact page

The contact page needs to have three main sections. The first is a Google map embed.

Below the map embed, there should be two columns. The left column should contain our address, email address and relephone number.

The right column should contain a contact form. For the purposes of this test, the form does not need to perform any action. Simply ensure that it includes the following fields:

•	Your name (text field)
•	Email address (text field/HTML5 email field)
•	Telephone number (text field/HTML5 tel field)
•	Message subject (text field)
•	Your message (textarea)

You can use whatever tools you like when building the site. You can use any frameworks, CSS pre-processors and Javascript libraries you are comfortable with.
